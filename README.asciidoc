CocoaLibSpotify
===============

CocoaLibSpotify is an Objective-C wrapper around our libspotify library. It provides easy access to libspotify's features in a friendly, KVC/O compliant Objective-C wrapper.

*IMPORTANT:* When checking out CocoaLibSpotify, please run a +git submodule update --init+ before trying to build the sample projects.

Building -  Mac OS X
====================

The Xcode project was built in Xcode 4.0, but should also work fine in Xcode 3.2.x.

CocoaLibSpotify requires libspotify.framework, which isn't included in the repository. The Xcode project includes a build step to download and unpack it from developer.spotify.com automatically. If this fails for some reason, download it manually from developer.spotify.com and unpack it into the project folder.

The built CocoaLibSpotify.framework contains libspotify.framework as a child framework. Sometimes, Xcode gives build errors complaining it can't find <libspotify/api.h>. If you get this, manually add the directory libspotify.framework is in to your project's "Framework Search Paths" build setting. For example, if you're building the CocoaLibSpotify.framework project with your application then copying it into your bundle, you'd have this:

`$CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR/CocoaLibSpotify.framework/Versions/Frameworks`

Otherwise, you'd point to the downloaded libspotify.framework manually, something like this:

`../../libspotify-9.1.32-Darwin-universal`

Building - iOS
==============

At the moment, the easiest way to build CocoaLibSpotify on iOS is to include all of the files in the "common" directory directory in your project. When you need to use CocoaLibSpotify, include the following header file and you'll have everything you need imported:

#import "CocoaLibSpotify.h"

Of course, you need to include libspotify in your project too. Simply download the archives from http://developer.spotify.com/ and include the library and api.h file in your project.

Documentation
=============

The headers of CocoaLibSpotify are well documented, and we've provided an Xcode DocSet to provide documentation right in Xcode. With these and the sample projects, you should have everything you need to dive right in!
